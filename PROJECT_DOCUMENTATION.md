# Sufra AR Project Documentation

## 1. Project Overview

Sufra AR is a premium WebAR restaurant menu product for restaurants, cafes, hotels, lounges, and hospitality venues. The current codebase is a static React + Vite frontend that can be deployed on Vercel and configured with local JavaScript data files.

Technical package/repository name: `sufra-ar`.
Public product/brand name: `Sufra AR`.

Core value:

- Guests scan a QR code for a restaurant.
- The website opens a mobile-first menu experience.
- Guests browse a grouped menu, use category pills as scroll shortcuts, search dishes, filter by food or drink type, inspect ingredients, and switch language.
- Guests open dish Details directly into the full viewer page.
- Dishes with models can switch between Photo and 3D; photo-only dishes such as drinks do not show AR.
- The AR viewer uses `<model-viewer>` for model-backed dishes so guests can preview dishes in 3D and view them on their table before ordering.

This is a frontend-only MVP/product shell. There is no backend, no database, no login system, no dashboard, and no payments.

## 2. Tech Stack

- React 19, rendered from `src/main.jsx`
- Vite 7, configured by `vite.config.js`
- Vercel, configured by `vercel.json`
- Google `<model-viewer>`, loaded from CDN in `index.html`
- `lucide-react` for UI icons
- Static JavaScript config files under `src/data`
- Static images under `public/images/dishes`
- Static 3D models under `public/models/dishes`
- No backend
- No database
- No payment integration

Important entry files:

- `index.html` loads Google Fonts, favicon, and the model-viewer CDN script.
- `src/main.jsx` mounts `<App />`.
- `src/App.jsx` currently contains routing, layout components, menu UI, dish modal, pricing, pages, footer, and model-viewer page.
- `src/styles.css` contains all current styling.

## 3. Core Rules / Non-Negotiables

- Do not add a backend.
- Do not add a database.
- Do not add login, dashboard, admin, or payment flows unless explicitly requested later.
- Do not hardcode restaurant/menu/pricing data inside UI components if it can live in config.
- Do not break AR/model-viewer.
- Do not duplicate image or model assets.
- Do not move assets unless a task explicitly asks for asset cleanup.
- Do not remove working routes.
- Keep the menu mobile-first.
- Keep desktop layouts clean and centered around the mobile app-style experience.
- Keep code beginner-friendly and scalable.
- Keep config files easy to edit.
- Run `npm.cmd run build` before finishing code changes.
- If editing visible copy, update the translation system, not scattered JSX strings.

## 4. Current Routes

Routing is implemented manually in `src/App.jsx` using `window.location.pathname` and query parameters.

Important functions:

- `getRouteFromPath()` parses the current path.
- `findRestaurantBySlug()` from `src/data/restaurants/index.js` finds matching restaurant config.
- `navigateToMenu(slug, query)` updates history state and route state.
- `openViewer(dish)` navigates to viewer query params.
- `backToMenu()` returns to the menu and clears modal state.

Routes:

| Route | Displays | Handler/component | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | Product landing page with hero, value section, QR demo section, pricing preview, footer | `LandingPage` inside `Shell` | The QR demo section links to the real guest-facing `/menu/demo` route instead of embedding a duplicate interactive menu. |
| `/pricing` | Full pricing page | `PricingPage` -> `PricingSection` | Pricing data comes from `src/data/plans.js`; visible translated text/features come from `src/data/translations.js`. |
| `/about` | About page | `AboutPage` -> `InfoPage` | Uses translated text from `src/data/translations.js`. |
| `/privacy` | Privacy Policy page | `PrivacyPage` inside `Shell` | Uses translated structured privacy content from `src/data/translations.js`; linked from the marketing footer in a new tab. |
| `/menu/demo` | Primary public demo menu page | `MenuExperience` inside `GuestMenuShell` | Loads `src/data/restaurants/sufra-old-town.js`; the file name is legacy, but the public slug is `demo`. |
| `/menu/demo-cafe` | Second sample restaurant menu page | `MenuExperience` inside `GuestMenuShell` | Loads `src/data/restaurants/demo-cafe.js`, which currently reuses most of the demo config with a different slug/name/subtitle. |
| `/sufra-old-town` | Legacy redirect | `getRouteFromPath` | Old public route. Do not use for new links; it is immediately normalized to `/menu/demo`. |
| `/demo-cafe` | Legacy direct sample route | `MenuExperience` inside `GuestMenuShell` | Kept for compatibility with the older top-level slug system. Prefer `/menu/demo-cafe` for new links. |
| `/<invalid-slug>` | Not found page | `NotFoundPage` | Any non-static path is treated as a restaurant slug. If not found, a clean not-found page appears. |

The homepage QR demo section is generated in React and encodes `https://sufraar.com/menu/demo` for client previews. `/menu/demo` remains the single real demo menu route and continues to reuse the existing demo restaurant config, images, and GLB models.

Marketing routes use the full `SiteHeader` and `Footer`, including the Privacy Policy link and copyright notice. Guest-facing menu routes use a simplified menu layout with no marketing header, a small `Designed with 🤍 by Sufra AR` credit footer, and a floating back-to-top button that appears after the guest scrolls down.

Viewer query route:

```text
/menu/demo?dish=pizza&view=viewer&lang=en
```

When `view=viewer` and `dish=<dish id>` matches a dish in the active restaurant config, `App` renders `ModelViewerPage`.

There is currently no `src/components` folder. Component functions are currently defined in `src/App.jsx`.

## 6. Data Architecture

Main data files:

- `src/data/restaurants/index.js`
  - Exports `languages`, `restaurants`, `defaultRestaurantSlug`, `defaultRestaurant`, and `findRestaurantBySlug`.
  - Current language selector labels are `ENG`, `GEO`, `RUS`.
  - Current registered restaurants are `sufraOldTown` and `demoCafe`.
- `src/data/restaurants/sufra-old-town.js`
  - Main default demo menu config.
  - This file keeps its legacy filename for safety, but its public slug is `demo` and its public route is `/menu/demo`.
  - Contains category definitions, dish data, image/model paths, ingredient tags, ingredient hotspots, AR scale/camera settings, and theme values.
- `src/data/restaurants/demo-cafe.js`
  - Second sample restaurant config.
  - Imports and spreads `sufraOldTown`, then changes `slug`, `restaurantName`, and `subtitle`.
- `src/data/plans.js`
  - Base pricing plan ids, English titles, prices, CTA names, and feature lists.
  - `App.jsx` uses plan ids and pulls translated display text from `src/data/translations.js`.
- `src/data/currencies.js`
  - GEL-only `formatPrice(priceGEL)` helper.
- `src/data/translations.js`
  - Main visible UI translation dictionary for `en`, `ka`, `ru`.
  - Exports `translations` and `getTranslation(language, key)`.
- `src/data/brand.js`
  - Brand-level contact and identity data: name, translated slogan, email, phone/WhatsApp, and social links.
- `src/data/siteContent.js`
  - Contains supporting landing/about copy objects.
  - Current `App.jsx` only uses `siteContent.hero.image` for the landing hero image. Most visible copy now comes from `translations.js`.

Important helper functions in `src/App.jsx`:

- `t(language, key)` reads translations through `getTranslation`.
- `tArray(language, key)` reads translated arrays such as feature lists.
- `text(value, language)` reads translated config objects with English fallback.
- `getPlanTitle(plan, language)`, `getPlanFeatures(plan, language)`, and `getPlanPrice(plan, language)` adapt pricing plan data to the active language.
- `translateIngredientName(name, language)` and `translateIngredientBenefit(benefit, language)` translate ingredient callout text.

## 7. Restaurant/Menu Config Rules

Current demo category ids:

```text
main-dishes
baked-goods
seafood
```

Every active demo dish should reference one of those ids with `categoryId`. Food categories use All / Veg filters; Meat is not shown as a filter or badge in the demo UI. The final demo menu has no active drinks category. If a future menu adds drinks, drink categories should use `drinkType` values such as `alcoholic` and `non-alcoholic` instead of Veg/Meat labels.

Drinks are photo-only. They should use existing dish photos, set `hasModel: false`, and should not render `model-viewer`, the Photo / 3D selector, or `View on your table`.

The menu renders these categories together as one continuous grouped menu. Category pills remain horizontally swipeable, stay sticky near the top while the guest scrolls, and scroll the page to the matching category section instead of permanently hiding the other sections. The active pill is updated from the visible section while the guest scrolls.

Each dish should include:

```js
{
  id: 'pizza',
  categoryId: 'baked-goods',
  type: 'meat', // food items use 'veg' or 'meat'; drinks use type: 'drink' plus drinkType
  name: { en: 'Pepperoni Pizza', ka: '...', ru: '...' },
  description: {
    en: 'Oven-baked pepperoni pizza with melted cheese and crisp golden crust.',
    ka: '...',
    ru: '...',
  },
  priceGEL: 32,
  calories: 980,
  image: '/images/dishes/pizza.webp',
  model: '/models/dishes/pizza.glb',
  hasModel: true,
  ingredients: [
    { name: 'Mozzarella', benefits: ['Calcium', 'Protein'] },
  ],
  ingredientHotspots: [
    {
      id: 'mozzarella',
      name: 'Mozzarella',
      position: '0m 0.08m 0m',
      normal: '0m 1m 0m',
      benefits: ['Protein', 'Iron'],
    },
  ],
  arScale: '1 1 1',
  arPlacement: 'floor',
  cameraOrbit: '35deg 70deg 2.5m',
  fieldOfView: '30deg',
}
```

Base price is always `priceGEL`. Dish prices always display in GEL through `formatPrice` in `src/data/currencies.js`; there is no USD/EUR conversion or currency selector.

Current category mapping in `sufra-old-town.js`:

- `main-dishes`: Chicken Wrap
- `baked-goods`: Lobiani, Pepperoni Pizza
- `seafood`: Sushi Platter

If a dish should be photo-only:

```js
model: '',
hasModel: false,
```

Calories are optional numeric values per dish. When present, `ModelViewerPage` shows them in the dish details card as a short value such as `620 Cal`. Demo calorie values are estimates only; real client menus should use client-provided values.

## 8. Asset Rules

Images should live in:

```text
public/images/dishes
```

Models should live in:

```text
public/models/dishes
```

Assets are referenced from React/config using public URL paths:

```js
image: '/images/dishes/pizza.webp'
model: '/models/dishes/pizza.glb'
```

Rules:

- Do not duplicate assets.
- Do not move or rename existing assets unless an asset-cleanup task explicitly asks for it.
- Be careful with current filenames containing uppercase letters or exact uploaded spellings.
- Use the exact path currently in config.
- For future assets, prefer lowercase kebab-case filenames, for example `chicken-alfredo.jpg` and `chicken-alfredo.glb`.
- If a dish should be photo-only, use `model: ''` and `hasModel: false` rather than inventing duplicate files.

Hero image currently used by the landing page:

```text
/images/dishes/fine dining table phone.jpg
```

## 9. AR / model-viewer Rules

`<model-viewer>` is loaded from CDN in `index.html`:

```html
<script
  type="module"
  src="https://unpkg.com/@google/model-viewer/dist/model-viewer.min.js"
></script>
```

The AR viewer is implemented in `ModelViewerPage` in `src/App.jsx`.

Flow:

1. User opens a dish card or Details button.
2. `openViewer(dish)` navigates directly to:

```text
/menu/demo?dish=<dish-id>&view=viewer&lang=<language>
```

3. `App` detects `view=viewer` and renders `ModelViewerPage`.
4. `ModelViewerPage` shows dish info, clickable ingredient chips/info, a small `Add to selection` or quantity control, and the media area.
5. Model-backed dishes show a Photo / 3D selector. Photo uses `dish.image`; 3D passes `dish.model`, `dish.arScale`, `dish.arPlacement`, `dish.cameraOrbit`, and `dish.fieldOfView` into `<model-viewer>`.
6. Dishes without models, including drinks, stay photo-only and do not render `<model-viewer>` or the AR launch button.

Current model-viewer realism settings:

- `ar`
- Platform-specific `ar-modes`
  - iOS/iPadOS: `quick-look`
  - Android: `scene-viewer webxr`
  - Default/desktop fallback: `scene-viewer webxr quick-look`
  - Android prioritizes native Scene Viewer before WebXR because testing showed better placement behavior.
- `ar-scale="fixed"`
- `disable-zoom`
- `camera-controls`
- `min-camera-orbit="auto 35deg auto"`
- `max-camera-orbit="auto 85deg auto"`
- `auto-rotate`
- `scale={modelScale}`
- `data-ar-platform={arPlatform}`
- `data-platform-scale={platformScaleMultiplier}`
- `data-ar-scale={modelScale}`
- `touch-action="pan-y"`

These settings apply only when the dish has a real model and is not in the `drinks` category.

`modelScale` is derived from the dish `arScale` multiplied by optional platform scale values:

```js
const modelScale = getModelScaleForPlatform(dish, arPlatform);
```

Platform scale override support is optional:

```js
platformScale: {
  default: 1,
  ios: 1,
  android: 1,
}
```

If `platformScale` is omitted, all multipliers default to `1`. Android values should stay `1` unless real Android testing proves a specific model needs calibration. This keeps one shared GLB per dish and avoids duplicate iOS/Android model files. Temporary calibration dishes should stay out of the active client demo menu unless a future testing task explicitly adds them back. There is a code comment in `ModelViewerPage` noting that iOS Quick Look may still use dimensions baked into the USDZ/GLB conversion.

Rules:

- Keep `ar-scale="fixed"` where possible.
- Use `arScale: '1 1 1'` by default so real-world size comes from the correctly exported GLB.
- Keep platform scale multipliers at `1` by default.
- Do not re-enable unrealistic free zoom/scale unless explicitly requested.
- User should be able to rotate/orbit horizontally in 3D preview, but vertical orbit is limited to prevent viewing unfinished model undersides. This does not change AR placement behavior.
- AR must keep launching normally on mobile for model-backed food dishes.
- Do not remove `<model-viewer>` or the AR slot button.
- Test viewer routes after AR changes.

## 10. Ingredient Callouts / Hotspots

Ingredient callouts are now shown as normal UI, not as visible `<model-viewer>` hotspot labels.

Data lives in each dish config under `ingredientHotspots`:

```js
ingredientHotspots: [
  {
    id: 'pepper',
    name: 'Pepper',
    position: '0.12m 0.12m 0.02m',
    normal: '0m 1m 0m',
    benefits: ['Spice', 'Antioxidants'],
  },
]
```

Rendering behavior:

- `ingredientHotspots` can remain in dish configs as ingredient metadata and future positioning data.
- Visible floating hotspot labels are no longer rendered over the 3D model.
- Viewer ingredient chips are rendered from `dish.ingredients` as clickable buttons.
- Tapping a chip opens a small white `IngredientInfoCard` overlay inside the black viewer preview area.
- Benefits are matched by ingredient name, using `dish.ingredients` first and `ingredientHotspots` as a fallback.
- Visible name/benefits are translated through `translateIngredientName` and `translateIngredientBenefit`.
- The real AR launch remains clean and should not show ingredient labels.

Important limitation:

This is not real 3D ingredient detection. Ingredient benefits are static menu metadata. Any `position` and `normal` values in `ingredientHotspots` are currently not used for visible UI.

Future improvements:

- Add richer ingredient/nutrition metadata.
- Tune or repurpose hotspot positions only if a future task explicitly brings back spatial callouts.

### My Selection

The mobile menu includes a frontend-only saved dishes feature called `My selection`.

Behavior:

- Guests can save dishes from menu cards and the full dish viewer page.
- When saved dishes exist, the menu shows a subtle bottom `View selection` access button.
- With no saved dishes, the top menu/header stays clean and selection access can remain hidden.
- Saved dishes store only dish ids and quantities in `localStorage`.
- Storage is per restaurant slug using `sufra-selection-${restaurant.slug}`.
- Rendering resolves dish details from the current restaurant config and ignores saved ids that no longer exist.
- Prices and estimated totals use `formatPrice` and display in GEL only.
- Dish names follow the current menu language.
- The bottom sheet says `Show this list to your waiter.`

Rules:

- This is not a cart, checkout, order submission, payment flow, table-number flow, or backend feature.
- Do not add backend/database/login/admin/payment/order behavior to this feature.

## 11. Price Display

Base currency is GEL. Currency switching and USD/EUR conversion have been removed.

The GEL-only price formatter lives in:

```text
src/data/currencies.js
```

Dish and selection prices are rendered with:

```js
formatPrice(dish.priceGEL)
```

Prices display as plain GEL text, for example `12 GEL`. Pricing plan prices are also displayed in GEL as static plan copy.

## 12. Language / Translation System

Supported languages:

- `en` -> selector label `ENG`
- `ka` -> selector label `GEO`
- `ru` -> selector label `RUS`

The first-time/default language is Georgian (`ka`). Saved user language values and explicit `lang=<code>` URL parameters still override the default.

Language registration lives in:

```text
src/data/restaurants/index.js
```

Visible UI translations live in:

```text
src/data/translations.js
```

Fallback behavior:

```js
translations[language]?.[key] ?? translations.en[key] ?? key
```

Config text objects use `text(value, language)` in `src/App.jsx`, with English fallback:

```js
return value?.[language] || value?.en || '';
```

What should translate:

- Hero text and buttons
- Product/value section
- Menu section titles/subtitles
- Category names
- Search placeholder
- Filters
- Dish descriptions when translations exist
- Dish detail/viewer action labels
- My selection labels, helper text, quantity labels, and empty states
- Back/viewer buttons
- AR helper text
- Ingredient labels/benefits
- Pricing section/page
- Pricing features and buttons
- About page
- Footer contact label
- Footer nav/contact labels
- Empty states

Must stay English:

- `Sufra AR`
- `Designed with 🤍 by Sufra AR`
- Email address
- Instagram handle
- Currency codes/symbols

Brand slogan translations:

- English: `See It Before You Order`
- Georgian: `ნახე, სანამ შეუკვეთავ`
- Russian: `Увидь перед заказом`

Site and menu language state are intentionally separate. Site language is stored under `sufra-site-language`; menu language is stored under `sufra-menu-language`. Older `sufra-language` values are used only as a fallback. Viewer URLs can also include `lang=<code>`, which applies to the menu/viewer context.

## 13. Theme System

There are two theme concepts:

1. Global site theme:
   - State: `themeMode`
   - Stored in `localStorage` as `sufra-theme`
   - Controls the landing/pages/footer wrapper through CSS variables from `getThemeStyle(restaurant, themeMode)`.

2. Menu app theme:
   - State: `menuTheme`
   - Stored in `localStorage` as `sufra-menu-theme`
   - Passed through `menuControls` so the toggle inside the menu affects the menu experience, not the whole website.
   - Used by classes `menu-theme-dark` and `menu-theme-light` in `src/styles.css`.

Theme CSS variables are set in `getThemeStyle`:

- `--bg`
- `--text`
- `--secondary-text`
- `--accent`
- `--card`
- `--border`
- dropdown contrast variables
- badge/CTA contrast variables
- `--heading-font`
- `--body-font`

Design contrast rules:

- The global site can be light or dark.
- The menu defaults to light for first-time guests, while the menu theme toggle and saved `sufra-menu-theme` preference still support dark mode.
- Dropdowns must stay readable in both light and dark themes.
- Buttons must keep black/white contrast.

## 14. Pricing System

Base plan data lives in:

```text
src/data/plans.js
```

The current plan ids and prices:

- Basic - 99 GEL / month
- Pro - 149 GEL / month, shown with the translated `Best value` badge
- Custom - Prices may vary

Pricing display is rendered by `PricingSection` in `src/App.jsx`.

Plan feature text is translated through `src/data/translations.js` with keys:

- `pricingBasicFeatures`
- `pricingProFeatures`
- `pricingCustomFeatures`

Current English feature bullets:

Basic:

- Maximum AR quantity: 20
- Full text and photo menu
- Ingredient tags
- Basic restaurant branding

Pro:

- Everything in Basic
- Unlimited AR dishes
- 1 free AR dish change per month
- Custom restaurant branding
- Priority menu updates
- Multi-location-ready structure

Custom:

- Custom solution for larger or special projects
- Flexible AR menu structure
- Custom scope based on restaurant needs
- Contact us for pricing

Basic and Pro cards show a subtle `+ setup fee` note near the monthly price. Custom shows `Prices may vary` and `Please contact us`; it does not show a fixed setup fee.

Pricing sections also show a subtle note: monthly subscription starts 1 month after the setup fee payment.

There is no payment integration. CTAs are mailto links.

## 15. Contact Links

Brand contact data lives in:

```text
src/data/brand.js
```

Current contact info:

- Email: `sufraar@gmail.com`
- Instagram: `https://www.instagram.com/sufraar/`
- Instagram handle: `@sufraar`
- TikTok: `https://www.tiktok.com/@sufra.ar`
- TikTok handle: `@sufra.ar`
- Facebook: `https://www.facebook.com/share/199UTeER2Z/?mibextid=wwXIfr`
- WhatsApp / phone: `(+995) 598 11 99 81`
- WhatsApp link: `https://wa.me/message/BMXAZDQRTUXEG1`

Current mailto links in `src/App.jsx`:

```js
const demoRequestHref = `mailto:${brand.email}?subject=Sufra%20AR%20Demo%20Request`;
```

Usage:

- Pricing Basic/Pro/Custom CTAs use demo request mailto.
- Footer email uses `mailto:sufraar@gmail.com`.
- Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and WhatsApp links use `target="_blank"` and `rel="noreferrer"`.

Desktop note:

Mailto behavior depends on the user's operating system/browser default mail app. The links should still be real anchors, not onClick-only buttons.

## 16. Footer Rules

Footer is implemented by `Footer` in `src/App.jsx`.

Footer must include:

- Logo + slogan
- Short Sufra AR description
- Nav links: Home, About
- Contact section label above contact/social links
- Email link
- Instagram link
- TikTok link
- Facebook link
- WhatsApp / phone link
- `Designed with 🤍 by Sufra AR`

Rules:

- Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and WhatsApp should appear only in the footer contact/social area, not in the footer nav.
- Logo text stays `Sufra AR`.
- Slogan uses the language-specific text from `brand.slogan`.
- Footer credit text stays `Designed with 🤍 by Sufra AR`.
- Footer nav labels should translate.
- Email address, phone number, social handles, and URLs should not translate.

## 17. Design Direction

Current visual direction:

- Premium
- Minimal
- Apple-like
- Black/white refined
- No gold/yellow brand accents
- Subtle shadows
- Rounded corners
- Quiet luxury hospitality feel

Hybrid design:

- Landing/product/static pages are light premium by default.
- The actual menu experience is a light mobile-first app-style UI by default, with a dark mode available from the menu theme toggle.
- The footer remains black.

Important CSS areas:

- Header/logo/control styling: `.site-header`, `.logo`, `.header-controls`, `.control-pill`
- Hero: `.product-hero`
- Pricing: `.pricing-section`, `.pricing-carousel-shell`, `.pricing-grid`, `.pricing-card`
- Menu app: `.menu-app`, `.menu-theme-dark`, `.menu-theme-light`
- Dish UI: `.dish-card`, `.viewer-info-card`, `.selection-sheet`
- AR viewer: `model-viewer`, `.viewer-photo`, `.viewer-media-toggle`, `.ingredient-info-card`, `.ar-button`
- Footer: `.site-footer`

## 18. Mobile-First Rules

Phone experience is the priority.

Rules:

- Menu UI must be thumb-friendly.
- Category slider must be horizontally swipeable, with a subtle visual swipe indicator near the right edge of the category row.
- Category pills scroll to their matching grouped menu sections, and the active pill updates as the user scrolls.
- Category changes reset the active type filter to All. Food categories show All / Veg filters only; Drinks use Alcoholic / Non-alcoholic filters and badges and remain photo-only.
- Search must remain usable on mobile. When a query is active, search runs across all dishes in the current restaurant, not only the selected category.
- Dish viewer details and selection controls must fit mobile screens.
- AR button must be obvious and reachable for model-backed food dishes.
- Pricing cards should swipe horizontally on mobile using CSS scroll-snap and initially center the Pro plan.
- Desktop can show the mobile app-style menu centered inside the page.
- Text must not overflow, especially Georgian and Russian.

Current mobile behaviors are mostly CSS-driven in `src/styles.css`.

## 19. Development Workflow

Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm.cmd install
```

Run local dev server:

```powershell
npm.cmd run dev
```

Expose to a phone on the same network:

```powershell
npm.cmd run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0
```

Build for production:

```powershell
npm.cmd run build
```

Preview production build:

```powershell
npm.cmd run preview
```

Recommended change workflow:

1. Check `git status`.
2. Inspect relevant files before editing.
3. Make small scoped edits.
4. Run `npm.cmd run build`.
5. Test affected routes locally.
6. Commit changes with a clear message.
7. Push to GitHub.
8. Vercel deploys from GitHub.

## 20. Deployment

The app is deployed on Vercel.

Production/custom domain:

```text
https://sufraar.com
```

Vercel behavior:

- GitHub push triggers deployment.
- Build command should be `npm.cmd run build` locally; Vercel normally runs `npm run build`.
- Output directory is `dist`.
- SSL is handled by Vercel.
- `vercel.json` rewrites all routes to `/index.html`, so direct visits like `/pricing`, `/menu/demo-cafe`, and `/menu/demo?dish=pizza&view=viewer` work with client-side routing.

Current `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

SEO/favicon notes:

- Browser and Search favicon source is `public/favicon.svg`.
- `index.html` references `/favicon.svg` in the head and also includes PNG fallbacks: `/favicon-48x48.png`, `/favicon-192x192.png`, and `/apple-touch-icon.png`.
- The favicon SVG is square and uses the black/white Sufra AR icon.
- Google Search may take days or weeks to refresh the displayed favicon after production deployment and recrawling.

## 22. Current Known Issues / Future Improvements

Known issues/cleanup notes from inspection:

- `src/App.jsx` currently contains many component functions. This works, but future cleanup could extract reusable components into `src/components`.
- `src/data/siteContent.js` contains supporting English content objects, while current visible copy mostly comes from `src/data/translations.js`; `App.jsx` currently uses only `siteContent.hero.image`.
- `src/data/restaurants/sufra-old-town.js` still has a legacy filename. The current public route is `/menu/demo`; `/sufra-old-town` redirects to `/menu/demo` and should not be used for new public links.
- `src/data/brand.js` contains some translated about/description copy, but current visible page copy mostly comes from `src/data/translations.js`; contact identity still comes from `brand.js`.
- The active demo config uses exact uploaded image filenames, including `Lobiani.webp` and `Sushi.webp`. Do not rename or move them unless doing an explicit approved asset cleanup.
- Future assets should prefer lowercase kebab-case.
- The final demo has no active drinks category; if drinks are added later, keep them photo-only with `hasModel: false` and no configured model path.
- `ingredientHotspots` positions are retained as data but are not currently rendered as visible model-viewer hotspot labels.
- iOS Quick Look may handle scale differently than WebXR/Scene Viewer.
- The temporary `Test` category/dish has been removed from the active demo menu config. The test GLB asset may remain in `public/models/dishes` for future calibration work unless an explicit asset cleanup removes it.

Planned/future improvements:

- Better 3D capture/model pipeline for real restaurant dishes.
- More real restaurant dish content and client configs.
- Better ingredient nutrition metadata and optional future spatial callout calibration.
- Asset folder cleanup and naming normalization.
- Component extraction from `App.jsx` once product behavior is stable.
- Optional test coverage for routing/data helpers.

## 23. How a Future Codex Agent Should Start

Checklist:

1. Read `PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md`.
2. Read `AGENTS.md`.
3. Run `git status --short` to see existing changes.
4. Inspect `src/App.jsx` for route/component flow.
5. Inspect `src/data/restaurants/index.js` and relevant restaurant config.
6. Inspect `src/data/translations.js` before editing visible copy.
7. Inspect `src/data/currencies.js` before changing prices/currency.
8. Inspect `src/data/plans.js` before changing pricing plan ids/prices.
9. Run `npm.cmd run build` before finishing.
10. Do not edit AR/model-viewer before understanding `ModelViewerPage`, `openViewer`, query routing, and dish `arScale`.
11. Make small changes.
12. Test affected local routes.
13. Avoid duplicate assets.
14. Preserve mobile-first behavior.
15. Preserve `/`, `/pricing`, `/about`, `/menu/demo`, `/menu/demo-cafe`, and the legacy `/sufra-old-town` redirect.
