# Sufra AR

Sufra AR is a static React + Vite WebAR menu product for restaurants, cafes, hotels, and lounges.

Technical package/repository name: `sufra-ar`.
Public product/brand name: `Sufra AR`.

There is no backend, database, login system, dashboard, or payment flow in this MVP. Restaurant pages, menu items, prices, images, 3D models, AR settings, and themes are controlled with simple config files.

## Run Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Routes

```text
/                  -> product landing page with QR demo and early-access request-demo section
/menu/demo         -> primary public demo menu
/menu/demo-cafe    -> second sample restaurant menu
/sufra-old-town    -> legacy route that redirects to /menu/demo
/demo-cafe         -> legacy direct route kept for compatibility

## Menu Features

- Guest-facing menu routes use a clean menu-only layout: no marketing website header, a small `Designed with 🤍 by Sufra AR` credit footer, and a floating back-to-top button after scrolling.
- The menu shows all current categories as one continuous grouped menu. Category pills scroll to their sections and update as the guest scrolls.
- Viewer ingredient chips are clickable and open a small normal UI info card. `ingredientHotspots` may remain in menu data, but visible labels no longer float over the 3D model.
- `My selection` is a local-only saved dishes list with compact dish card/viewer-page add controls and a subtle bottom `View selection` access button after dishes are saved. It stores dish ids and quantities per restaurant in `localStorage` with `sufra-selection-${restaurant.slug}`.
- `My selection` is not checkout, ordering, payment, table submission, or a backend feature.

The first-time/default language is Georgian (`ka`). Saved user choices and explicit `lang=` URL query parameters still override that default.

## Add A New Restaurant

1. Copy an existing config:

```text
src/data/restaurants/sufra-old-town.js
```

The current default demo config keeps this legacy filename for safety, but its public slug is `demo` and its public URL is `/menu/demo`.

2. Rename the copied file to the new restaurant name, for example:

```text
src/data/restaurants/new-restaurant.js
```

3. Edit the exported config:

- `slug`
- `brandName`
- `restaurantName`
- `subtitle`
- `locationLabel`
- `mapUrl`
- `heroImage`
- `theme`
- `categories`
- `dishes`

4. Import and register it in:

```text
src/data/restaurants/index.js
```

Adding a client should usually mean copying one restaurant config and editing data.

## Edit Menu Data

Each dish can control:

- `id`
- `categoryId`
- `type` as `veg` or `meat` for food, or `drink` for drinks
- `drinkType` for drinks, such as `alcoholic` or `non-alcoholic`
- translated `name`
- translated `description`
- `priceGEL`
- numeric `calories` when available; the UI displays it as `620 Cal`
- `image`
- `model`
- `hasModel`
- `ingredients`
- `ingredientHotspots`
- `arScale`
- `arPlacement`
- `cameraOrbit`
- `fieldOfView`

Example:

```js
{
  id: 'pizza',
  categoryId: 'baked-goods',
  type: 'meat',
  priceGEL: 32,
  calories: 980,
  image: '/images/dishes/pizza.webp',
  model: '/models/dishes/pizza.glb',
  hasModel: true,
  arScale: '1 1 1',
  arPlacement: 'floor',
  cameraOrbit: '35deg 70deg 2.5m',
  fieldOfView: '30deg',
}
```

The current demo menu uses `main-dishes`, `baked-goods`, and `seafood`. Food categories show All / Veg filters only; Meat is not shown as a visible filter or badge. If a future menu adds drinks, drinks should stay photo-only and should not show AR/model-viewer.

If a dish should be photo-only, use:

```js
model: '',
hasModel: false,
```

## Price Display

Base prices are always stored in GEL with `priceGEL`.

GEL-only formatting lives in:

```text
src/data/currencies.js
```

Currency switching and USD/EUR conversion are not active. Dish prices display as plain GEL text, for example `12 GEL`.

## QR Codes

The homepage includes a code-generated QR demo section that points to the live demo URL:

```text
https://sufraar.com/menu/demo
```

Deploy the app, then generate one QR code per restaurant URL for each real client venue.

Examples:

```text
https://domain.com/menu/demo
https://domain.com/menu/demo-cafe
```

Use any QR code generator, paste the restaurant URL, and print the QR for tables, menus, or signage.

Do not use `/sufra-old-town` for new QR codes or public links. It is a legacy route that redirects to `/menu/demo` only to protect old visits.

## Vercel Deployment

Use the default Vite settings:

- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `dist`

The included `vercel.json` rewrites direct URLs like `/menu/demo`, `/menu/demo-cafe`, `/pricing`, and `/about` back to the React app, so QR-code visits and page refreshes work on Vercel.
